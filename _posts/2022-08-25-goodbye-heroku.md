title: Goodbye Heroku
---

Finding out about [Heroku removing the free tier](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq) does sting a bit. Being one of the first PaaS services I ever used it’s a little sad to see it go. Having used the free tier and the paid tiers in the past, I can’t help but wonder what else is out there…

But first, is free PaaS a pipe dream? Everyone needs to earn a living but at what point does free become impossible, for Heroku, that point has been crossed. I am sure there will be others spout up and give it a go, but they won’t last. We need to be able to be flexible, learn to pivot if need be or just pay up. 

So, here’s one ☕ Heroku, thanks for making your free tier service, it was great while it lasted. 

## Other PaaS possibilities

### Render

I have not used Render, but it looks like it can do just about all what Heroku does (Host rails, php, nodejs, etc.. with a free tier).

### AWS

Aws has a free tier. It might be a little low powered, but you can get something up and running for free using a myriad of services. You may also need to know a bit more linux commands to get your service up and running, but it’s an option.

- AWS BeanStalk https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk 
- AWS S3 https://aws.amazon.com/s3 
- AWS EC2 https://aws.amazon.com/ec2 
- AWS RDS https://aws.amazon.com/rds 

### Netlify

Reminds me of the old divshot day (who remembers that?) great for static hosting, free.

### Github Pages

I personally use Github Pages. It’s great, it’s fast and easy to get your static store hosted!
