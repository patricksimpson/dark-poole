Hey, I am Patrick! ðŸ‘‹
I have been writing software 20 years, current at Redi Health.

Recently, Iâ€™ve made the switch to Jekyll. Previously, I maintained my own static blog for almost 10 years. Older posts can be found on my [github repo](https://github.com/patricksimpson/posts).

You can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/patricksimpson) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simpsonpatrick/).
